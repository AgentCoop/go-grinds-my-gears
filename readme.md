This is a repository where I will be ranting about Go features I don't like, and features that Go, in my opinion,
lacks.

### Unused imports and variables (<=1.15)
This is probably the most idiotic, the most annoying behaviour of Go compiler. Many people had been [asking](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/OBsCksYHPG4) for years
to add an option to turn off errors generated by that check, or at least to reduce them to warnings. Alas, things haven't
moved an inch. Let's dive into Go [documantation](https://golang.org/doc/faq#unused_variables_and_imports) and see what is
the reason behind that:

> ##### Can I stop these complaints about my unused variable/import?
> The presence of an unused variable may indicate a bug, while unused imports just slow down compilation, an effect that can become substantial as a program accumulates code and programmers over time. For these reasons, Go refuses to compile programs with unused variables or imports, trading short-term convenience for long-term build speed and program clarity.

> Still, when developing code, it's common to create these situations temporarily and it can be annoying to have to edit them out before the program will compile.

> Some have asked for a compiler option to turn those checks off or at least reduce them to warnings. Such an option has not been added, though, because compiler options should not affect the semantics of the language and because the Go compiler does not report warnings, only errors that prevent compilation.

> There are two reasons for having no warnings. First, if it's worth complaining about, it's worth fixing in the code. (And if it's not worth fixing, it's not worth mentioning.) Second, having the compiler generate warnings encourages the implementation to warn about weak cases that can make compilation noisy, masking real errors that should be fixed.

> It's easy to address the situation, though. Use the blank identifier to let unused things persist while you're developing.

```go
import "unused"

// This declaration marks the import as used by referencing an
// item from the package.
var _ = unused.Item  // TODO: Delete before committing!

func main() {
    debugData := debug.Profile()
    _ = debugData // Used only during debugging.
    ....
}
```
> Nowadays, most Go programmers use a tool, goimports, which automatically rewrites a Go source file to have the correct imports, eliminating the unused imports issue in practice. This program is easily connected to most editors to run automatically when a Go source file is written.

The solution Go developers are offering is to use ad-hoc tools to remove unused imports, and add lines of code like this
_\_ = debugData_. Well, that hardly can be deemed as a solution. Adding (or deleting) hundreds and hundreds lines of code during
 program development does definitely incur some penalties on productivity without any improvements in overall
 program quality.
 
 A programmer is akin to a sculptor. To make a sculpture of the Appollo Belvedere, no one would start off from working on foot
 fingers. You would tend to get a vague look of what you are making by removing with a chisel large parts of a marbel block.
 Once a shape of human body emerge itself, you switch your focus on anatomical features of the face, legs, torso, and so on
 until your sculpture is finished.

The same things apply to the programming. At the beginning a programmer focuses on overall structure of his/her program
leaving out many details. Having lots of unused variables, commented out lines of codes is a natural way of program
development at that stage. You are roughing out your program to get an idea what it will be and how it will function.
Once it's 95% ready, it's time to "polish" your code. That's when the current behaviour of Go compiler is required.

Enforcing to remove unsed variables at the very beginning is the same as enforcing people to polish a turd. Seriously,
that's what I think about any of my program until it's finished: it's a big smelly turd that I have to enhance in the
process of its development. There are few geniuses among us that can write a flowless code from scratch.

After all, Donald Knuth once said: _"Premature optimization is the root of all evil"_, and enforcing to remove unused variabels at the
beginning of program development is nothing else as a premature optimization.

Current implementation of Go compiler does not have any debug/release configuration. For instance, to remove symbol and
debug information from binaries one has to invoke Go builder with the following options: _go build -ldflags "-s -w"_
 
Taking into account aforementioned, the real solution would be a long-awaited option **--release** that would check for all
unused variables, imports (probably do some other checks) and finally build an optimized executable file for the target
platform. 
 
**But, for the time being, unused-variable-errors are really grinding my gears!**
